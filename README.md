# SafeKeep: Secure Time-Locked Multi-Signature Vault

## Overview

SafeKeep is a sophisticated Stacks blockchain smart contract that provides a highly secure and flexible asset storage solution. It enables users to create time-locked vaults with advanced multi-signature controls, partial withdrawal mechanisms, and emergency unlock options.

## Key Features

### üîí Enhanced Security
- **Multi-Signature Authentication**: Requires multiple signers to approve transactions
- **Configurable Signature Thresholds**: Customize the number of required signatures
- **Time-Based Locks**: Prevent premature asset withdrawal

### üïí Flexible Withdrawal Options
- **Partial Withdrawal Support**: Withdraw portions of locked assets under specific conditions
- **Granular Access Controls**: Define precise rules for asset release
- **Milestone-Based Unlocking**: Partial withdrawals tied to predefined conditions

### üö® Emergency Mechanisms
- **Optional Emergency Unlock**: Provide a trusted guardian with fallback access
- **Configurable Emergency Conditions**: Set specific unlock parameters

### üõ°Ô∏è Robust Validation
- Comprehensive input validation
- Strict access control checks
- Protection against unauthorized transactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain development environment
- Clarinet for smart contract development and testing
- Basic understanding of Clarity smart contract language

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/safekeeper.git
cd safekeeper
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Deploy the smart contract
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Vault
```clarity
(create-vault 
  release-timestamp       ;; When funds can be fully withdrawn
  required-signatures     ;; Number of signatures needed
  signers                 ;; List of authorized signers
  initial-deposit         ;; Initial amount to lock
  guardian                ;; Optional emergency contact
  emergency-unlock-flag   ;; Enable emergency unlock
  emergency-unlock-time   ;; Optional emergency unlock timestamp
  partial-unlock-threshold ;; Divisor for partial withdrawals
  partial-signatures-required ;; Signatures needed for partial withdrawals
)
```

### Requesting Partial Withdrawal
```clarity
(request-partial-withdrawal 
  vault-id    ;; Unique vault identifier
  amount      ;; Withdrawal amount
  recipient   ;; Withdrawal destination
)
```

### Signing Partial Withdrawal
```clarity
(sign-partial-withdrawal 
  vault-id       ;; Vault identifier
  withdrawal-id  ;; Specific withdrawal request
)
```

## Security Considerations
- Always verify signer credentials
- Use minimal, trusted guardian accounts
- Implement additional off-chain verification for high-value vaults

## Limitations
- Maximum of 5 signers per vault
- Partial withdrawal amounts are strictly controlled
- Emergency unlock requires predefined guardian
